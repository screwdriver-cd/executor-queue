> An executor plugin that routes builds through a Redis queue

The executor-queue for Screwdriver will push new jobs into a Redis queue. Other executors such as [executor-docker](https://github.com/screwdriver-cd/executor-docker) and [executor-k8s-vm](https://github.com/screwdriver-cd/executor-k8s-vm) will process jobs from this queue.

## Usage

```bash
$ npm install screwdriver-executor-queue
```

### Interface

It will initialize a connection to [node-resque](https://github.com/taskrabbit/node-resque) with the provided connection details. You can optionally pass in [circuit-fuses](https://github.com/screwdriver-cd/circuit-fuses) breaker options.

Configuration for any executors must be given directly to the [workers](https://github.com/screwdriver-cd/queue-worker) that read from the queue.

**Example executor yaml section:**
```yaml
executor:
    plugin: queue
    options:
        redisConnection:
            host: "127.0.0.1"
            port: 9999
            password: "hunter2"
            database: 0
```

## Testing

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm test
```
